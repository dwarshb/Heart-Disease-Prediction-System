# HeartDisease
Heart Disease Prediction System is an web application which helps the user to know that they may have any heart disease or not.
The Application is developed using Web Components & Python.  We have used flask to integrate HTML with python.
The Web Component are used for front-end through which user interacts with system. User have to answer certain questions displayed on system.
Based on this parameter the python algorithm uses MultiLayer Perceptron Algorithm to predict the output result. Before predicting the result.
The Algorithm gets trained using trained datasets. In this system we have used "Cleveland Dataset Of Heart Disease". This datasets consist of
295 entries with 8 parameters. The Accuracy of MLP Algorithm is 98%.
